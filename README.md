# NFTV
NFT viewing app

NFTV turns your device into an NFT art display. Select pieces from your NFT collection using your Ethereum wallet address or Nifty account. Art is displayed with QR code linking to the blockchain for proof of ownership.

What is an NFT?
NFTs are Non Fungible Tokens, and are used to prove ownership of many things including digital art.

What if I don't own any NFTs?
You can easily buy some from any of the NFT marketplaces (SuperRare.com, NiftyGateway.com, Foundation.app, Makersplace.com, etc.) or start off by viewing other peoples collection, feel free to check mine out:
